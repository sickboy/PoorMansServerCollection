# Poor mans server collections - For Play withSIX

## Introduction

We're working hard on providing you with an amazing Collection Sharing experience, which we plan to introduce in the next few months.

But for now, here is a quick way on how to deal with the Steam Query limitations for the ARMA2OA and ARMA3 games.

## How to

1. Edit our_server1.yml; add appropriate ip and port of the server.
2. Upload both yml files to dropbox or other hosting service of your choice
3. add pws:// uri to server.yml into server name, which will be picked up by our client.
   example: Our server [UK] pws://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u6666666666666666666/our_server1.yml

Optionally edit config.yml and server.yml more to your liking.

Enjoy!

This is very dated by now though ;-) Recommend to wait for the next evolution of collection sharing :)
